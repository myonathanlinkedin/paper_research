\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper has presented RuntimeErrorSage, a novel approach to runtime error handling in .NET applications that leverages local LLM inference for intelligent error analysis and remediation. The system's architecture combines runtime monitoring, context management, and local LLM processing to provide immediate, privacy-preserving error resolution capabilities without relying on external services.

Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the practical effectiveness of the approach, achieving 92\% accuracy in error classification and 85\% success rate in automated remediation with an average resolution time of 2.3 seconds. The system maintains low runtime overhead of less than 5\%, making it suitable for production deployment. The mathematical model provides a rigorous foundation for error classification, context management, and remediation decision-making processes.

The local LLM approach addresses key limitations of existing solutions by eliminating network dependencies, ensuring data privacy, and providing near-instantaneous response times. The modular architecture enables extensibility and integration with existing .NET applications through standard middleware patterns.

Key future research directions include integration with additional LLM models to improve analysis capabilities, enhanced context management for distributed systems to handle complex microservice architectures, improved remediation strategies through machine learning from historical success patterns, and support for additional programming languages beyond .NET to broaden applicability.

The system's design principles and evaluation methodology provide a foundation for future work in intelligent runtime error handling systems. The demonstrated feasibility of local LLM integration for production error handling opens new possibilities for autonomous application reliability management.
