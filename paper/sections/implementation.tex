\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}
RuntimeErrorSage is implemented as a lightweight, high performance .NET middleware layer designed to integrate seamlessly into existing .NET applications with minimal configuration and overhead. The system intercepts runtime exceptions and events before they cause application crashes or propagate up the call stack unhandled. Our implementation targets the .NET 9 runtime environment, leveraging its modern features for performance and interoperability. The core components are implemented in C\#, making extensive use of asynchronous programming patterns to ensure that error handling and analysis do not block the main application threads.

The system's interaction with the Large Language Model is facilitated by a standard HTTP API interface. This design choice provides flexibility, allowing RuntimeErrorSage to communicate with any LLM server that exposes a compatible API, such as LM Studio, vLLM, or OpenAI API compatible endpoints. For the purpose of this research and implementation, we specifically utilize the Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct 1M model, hosted locally via an HTTP API server. This local deployment is critical for meeting the privacy and low latency requirements of runtime error remediation in sensitive environments.

The primary technologies and components used in the implementation include .NET 9 runtime environment for the core framework, C\# as the primary programming language, Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct 1M Model as the local LLM, standard HTTP API for LLM communication, in-memory context graph using graph libraries, asynchronous programming with Task Parallel Library (TPL), and logging framework integration with common .NET libraries such as Serilog and NLog.

\subsection{Performance Optimization}
RuntimeErrorSage minimizes runtime overhead introduced by error analysis and remediation by employing several optimization techniques as described in the literature~\cite{llm_inference_optimization_2021, performance_tuning_dotnet_2020}. These optimizations include:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Asynchronous context collection}: Task-based programming prevents the interception process from significantly delaying the application's execution flow.
\item \textbf{Batched model inference}: The LLM Orchestrator allows multiple requests to be batched for more efficient processing when errors occur in quick succession.
\item \textbf{Dynamic batch sizing}: Adjusts the batch size based on current system load and LLM server capacity to maintain responsiveness.
\item \textbf{Context pruning}: Removes less relevant information from the context graph before LLM processing.
\item \textbf{Caching}: Common error patterns allow immediate remediation decisions for frequent errors without requiring a full LLM inference cycle.
\item \textbf{Optimized data serialization}: Minimizes parsing and data transfer overhead.
\end{itemize}

The impact of these optimizations on overall latency can be modeled using the following equation:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\text{latency} &\approx \text{base\_inference\_latency} + \text{data\_transfer\_time} \\
&\quad + \text{processing\_overhead} - \sum_{i} w_i \cdot \text{optimization\_effect}_i
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $w_i$ represents the weight of each optimization technique and $\text{optimization\_effect}_i$ represents the latency reduction achieved by each optimization.

\subsection{Error Recovery and Remediation Execution}
RuntimeErrorSage's Remediation Engine orchestrates the execution of the chosen remediation action in a safe and controlled manner by interacting with the application's state based on the analysis provided by the LLM Orchestrator. The process follows a state machine execution flow to ensure reliability and the possibility of rollback, and the system maintains a simplified view of the application's state to reason about the safety and impact of actions.

The Remediation Engine implements the following key components:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Pre-execution validation}: Checking system state and verifying preconditions before applying remediation actions
\item \textbf{Action execution}: Modifying variable values, calling recovery methods, restarting components, or applying configuration changes
\item \textbf{Post-execution verification}: Checking for the original error's persistence and monitoring for new issues
\item \textbf{State rollback}: Reverting the application state to a consistent point prior to remediation in case of failure
\item \textbf{Feedback loop}: Providing outcome information to update historical success rates and inform future LLM decisions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Core Implementation}

\subsubsection{LM Studio Integration}
RuntimeErrorSage's LM Studio integration consists of an API client using an HTTP client for the LM Studio API endpoint (e.g., \texttt{http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1}), request/response handling, error handling with retry logic, and performance monitoring. The model configuration uses the qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m model with 4-bit quantization, a context window of 4096 tokens, and a temperature of 0.7, chosen to balance memory efficiency and creativity.

The error analysis pipeline includes error context collection, prompt generation, response parsing, and remediation validation as described in the paper.

\subsubsection{Model Context Protocol Implementation}
RuntimeErrorSage's Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines a structured interface using a JSON schema between the runtime system and the LLM. The JSON schema for context representation includes the following fields:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Error metadata}: Type, stack trace, timestamp
\item \textbf{Application state}: Active requests, resource usage
\item \textbf{Historical context}: Similar past errors, remediation attempts
\item \textbf{System metrics}: CPU, memory, network utilization
\end{itemize}

The MCP implementation uses a directed graph where nodes represent system components or error states and edges indicate causal relationships or data flow to model error propagation and system dependencies. The graph is dynamically updated during error analysis.

The LLM prompt engineering for RuntimeErrorSage follows a structured template including error classification, root cause analysis using graph traversal, remediation strategy generation, and action safety validation. The prompt is constructed with attention to context window optimization through pruning irrelevant nodes, causal chain preservation, action safety constraints, and historical success patterns.

\subsubsection{Remediation Action System}
The remediation action system uses a state machine to orchestrate the execution of LLM-suggested fixes. Each remediation action is represented as a transition in the state machine, with defined preconditions, postconditions, and rollback procedures. The system maintains an action registry mapping error patterns to verified remediation strategies so that common issues are remediated quickly, while unique or rare cases are handled via custom remediation strategies.
