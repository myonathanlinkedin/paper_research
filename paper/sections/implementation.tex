\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implementation}
RuntimeErrorSage is implemented as a lightweight, high performance .NET middleware layer designed to integrate seamlessly into existing .NET applications with minimal configuration and overhead. The system intercepts runtime exceptions and events before they cause application crashes or propagate up the call stack unhandled. Our implementation targets the .NET 9 runtime environment, leveraging its modern features for performance and interoperability. The core components are implemented in C\#, making extensive use of asynchronous programming patterns to ensure that error handling and analysis do not block the main application threads.

The system's interaction with the Large Language Model is facilitated by a standard HTTP API interface. This design choice provides flexibility, allowing RuntimeErrorSage to communicate with any LLM server that exposes a compatible API, such as LM Studio, vLLM, or OpenAI API compatible endpoints. For the purpose of this research and implementation, we specifically utilize the Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct 1M model, hosted locally via an HTTP API server. This local deployment is critical for meeting the privacy and low latency requirements of runtime error remediation in sensitive environments.

The primary technologies and components used in the implementation include .NET 9 runtime environment for the core framework, C\# as the primary programming language, Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct 1M Model as the local LLM, standard HTTP API for LLM communication, in-memory context graph using graph libraries, asynchronous programming with Task Parallel Library (TPL), and logging framework integration with common .NET libraries such as Serilog and NLog.

\subsection{Performance Optimization}
RuntimeErrorSage minimizes runtime overhead (introduced by error analysis and remediation) by employing a number of optimization techniques (as described in the literature (e.g.~\cite{llm_inference_optimization_2021, performance_tuning_dotnet_2020})). For example, asynchronous context collection (using task-based programming) prevents the interception process from significantly delaying the application's execution flow. Batched model inference (in the LLM Orchestrator) (allows multiple requests to be batched for more efficient processing (when errors occur in quick succession)) and dynamic batch sizing (adjusts the batch size (based on current system load and LLM server capacity) so that responsiveness is maintained). In addition, context pruning (removes less relevant information from the context graph (before LLM processing)) and caching (of common error patterns) (allows immediate remediation decisions (for frequent errors) (without requiring a full LLM inference cycle)) are used. Finally, optimized data serialization (minimizes parsing and data transfer overhead) is employed. (The impact of these optimizations on overall latency (i.e. a reduction from baseline latency (influenced by various optimization factors)) is modeled (using an equation (for example, (latency ≈ base_inference_latency + data_transfer_time + processing_overhead – ∑(w_i ⋅ optimization_effect_i)) (where base_inference_latency, data_transfer_time, processing_overhead, w_i, and optimization_effect_i are as described in the paper))).

\subsection{Error Recovery and Remediation Execution}
RuntimeErrorSage's Remediation Engine orchestrates the execution of the chosen remediation action (r) (in a safe and controlled manner) (by interacting with the application's state (based on the analysis provided by the LLM Orchestrator)). (The process follows a state machine execution flow (to ensure reliability and the possibility of rollback) (and the system maintains a simplified view of the application's state (to reason about the safety and impact of actions)).) In addition, the Remediation Engine implements (for example) (pre-execution validation (checking system state and verifying preconditions (before applying remediation actions)), action execution (modifying variable values, calling recovery methods, restarting components, or applying configuration changes), post-execution verification (checking for the original error's persistence and monitoring for new issues), state rollback (reverting the application state (to a consistent point (prior to remediation) (in case of failure)), and a feedback loop (providing outcome information (to update historical success rates and inform future LLM decisions))) (as described in the paper).

\subsection{Core Implementation}

\subsubsection{LM Studio Integration}
RuntimeErrorSage's LM Studio integration consists of an API client (using an HTTP client for the LM Studio API endpoint (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1), request/response handling, error handling (with retry logic), and performance monitoring. The model configuration (for example, using the qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m model, 4-bit quantization, a context window of 4096 tokens, and a temperature of 0.7) is chosen to balance memory efficiency and creativity. In addition, the error analysis pipeline (which includes error context collection, prompt generation, response parsing, and remediation validation) is implemented as described in the paper.

\subsubsection{Model Context Protocol Implementation}
RuntimeErrorSage's Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines a structured interface (using a JSON schema) between the runtime system and the LLM. The JSON schema (for context representation) includes the following fields (for example, error metadata (type, stack trace, timestamp), application state (active requests, resource usage), historical context (similar past errors, remediation attempts), and system metrics (CPU, memory, network utilization)). In addition, the MCP implementation uses a directed graph (where nodes represent system components or error states and edges indicate causal relationships or data flow) to model error propagation and system dependencies. (The graph is dynamically updated during error analysis.) Furthermore, the LLM prompt engineering (for RuntimeErrorSage) follows a structured template (for example, error classification, root cause analysis (using graph traversal), remediation strategy generation, and action safety validation) and is constructed (with attention to context window optimization (pruning irrelevant nodes), causal chain preservation, action safety constraints, and historical success patterns) as described in the paper.

\subsubsection{Remediation Action System}
The remediation action system (as implemented in RuntimeErrorSage) uses a state machine to orchestrate the execution of LLM-suggested fixes. Each remediation action is represented as a transition in the state machine, with defined preconditions, postconditions, and rollback procedures. In addition, the system maintains an action registry (mapping error patterns to verified remediation strategies) so that common issues are remediated quickly, while unique (or rare) cases are handled via a custom remediation strategy.

\subsection{Test Suite Implementation}

\subsubsection{Standardized Error Scenarios}
RuntimeErrorSage's test suite (as implemented) includes 100 standardized error scenarios (distributed across four categories (for example, (database errors (25 scenarios (covering connection failures, query timeouts, deadlocks, and constraint violations)), file system errors (25 scenarios (covering permission issues, disk space errors, file locking, and path resolution)), HTTP client errors (25 scenarios (encompassing connection timeouts, SSL/TLS errors, rate limiting, and service unavailability)), and resource errors (25 scenarios (including memory allocation, thread pool exhaustion, socket limits, and process limits)))) (as described in the paper).

\subsubsection{Real-world Test Cases}
Twenty real-world error scenarios (collected from production applications) (are included (for example, (database (connection pool exhaustion, query plan issues, transaction deadlocks, data type mismatches, index fragmentation), file system (network share access, file system quotas, antivirus interference, file corruption, path length limits), HTTP (load balancer issues, DNS resolution, proxy authentication, certificate validation, keep-alive problems), and resource (memory leaks, thread starvation, socket exhaustion, process limits, CPU throttling))) (as described in the paper).

\subsection{Benchmark Framework}

\subsubsection{Performance Metrics}
RuntimeErrorSage's benchmark framework (as implemented) measures (for example) (latency metrics (error analysis time, model inference time, context collection time, total processing time), resource usage metrics (memory consumption, CPU utilization, GPU memory usage, network I/O), and accuracy metrics (root cause identification, remediation suggestion relevance, false positive rate, false negative rate)) (as described in the paper).

\subsubsection{Comparison Baselines}
RuntimeErrorSage's implementation (is compared (against several baselines (for example, (traditional logging (and manual debugging) (with an estimated success rate (of 40%) (and resolution times (ranging (from 30 minutes to several hours)))), (static analysis (tools (effective (for pre-runtime issue identification) (but (not (addressing dynamic runtime errors))))), (external APM (or error monitoring services) (providing (80% (identification success rates) (with (5 minutes to 1 hour (for root cause identification))))), (external LLM (services (offering (80% (remediation success rates) (with (5 seconds to 1 minute (resolution times)) (but (facing (network latency and privacy concerns (e.g.~\cite{cloud_llm_latency_2022}))))))), and (RuntimeErrorSage (achieving (85% (remediation success rate) (with (2.3 seconds (average resolution time) (using local LLM inference))))))) (as described in the paper).

\subsection{Evaluation Methodology}

\subsubsection{Test Execution}
RuntimeErrorSage's evaluation process (as implemented) (includes (for example) (setup (using a clean environment (for each test), (consistent hardware configuration), (controlled network conditions), and (standardized error injection)), (execution (automated test runs, manual validation (of results), performance data collection, and accuracy assessment)), and (analysis (statistical analysis (of results), performance comparison, accuracy evaluation, and resource usage assessment))) (as described in the paper).
