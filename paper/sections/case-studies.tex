\section{Case Studies}\label{sec:case-studies}

This section presents simulated case studies of RuntimeErrorSage, designed to evaluate the system's theoretical effectiveness in handling complex runtime errors. These simulations are based on common error patterns observed in production environments but are not actual production data~\cite{production_error_analysis_2023, runtime_remediation_2024}. The simulations demonstrate the system's potential capabilities and guide future real-world implementation.

\subsection{Simulated Enterprise E-commerce Platform}

\subsubsection{Simulation Scenario}

\subsubsection{Simulated Error Analysis}
RuntimeErrorSage's simulated analysis of the following error pattern:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=csharpstyle,caption={Simulated Database Connection Pool Error}]
