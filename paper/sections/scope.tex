\section{Scope of Research}

This research outlines the scope for \textit{CodeSage}, a middleware layer designed to enhance software reliability in .NET 9 applications through intelligent runtime error handling. The scope is defined as follows:

\subsection{Project Structure}
The research is implemented as a .NET solution (\textit{CodeSage.sln}) comprising the following projects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{CodeSage.Core} – Contains the core logic and interfaces:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{ICodeSageService} and \textit{CodeSageService} for orchestrating exception processing
        \item \textit{ILMStudioClient} and \textit{LMStudioClient} for local LLM integration (using \textit{qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m} via LM Studio at \textit{http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1})
        \item \textit{IMCPClient} and \textit{MCPClient} for distributed context sharing
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{CodeSage.Middleware} – Implements the ASP.NET Core middleware (\textit{CodeSageMiddleware}) that:
    \begin{itemize}

        \item Processes exceptions through the core service
        \item Applies remediation strategies
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{CodeSage.Tests} – Contains xUnit tests validating:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Exception interception and context enrichment
        \item LM Studio client integration
        \item MCP client functionality
        \item Middleware behavior
        \item Operation simulator functionality
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{CodeSage.Examples} – Provides example endpoints demonstrating CodeSage's capabilities:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Database operations with connection issues
        \item File operations with resource management
        \item External service integration
        \item Resource allocation and management
