# RuntimeErrorSage

Runtime Error Sage is a .NET library for intelligent runtime error analysis and remediation using local large language models. This implementation is based on the paper described in `paper/main.tex`.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development/prototype phase. The core architecture and interfaces have been defined, but there are still implementation gaps that need to be addressed.

## Main Components

1. **Error Analysis**: Analyzes runtime exceptions to determine root causes
2. **Remediation**: Provides strategies to fix or mitigate errors
3. **Graph Analysis**: Analyzes dependencies between components to determine error impact
4. **LLM Integration**: Uses local large language models for intelligent error analysis

## Challenges and Fixes

The codebase had several structural issues that have been partially addressed:

1. **Interface Conflicts**: Fixed conflicts between duplicate interface definitions
   - Resolved ambiguity between `IRemediationStrategy` interfaces in different namespaces
   - Fixed namespace references in service implementations

2. **Model Inconsistencies**: Started alignment of model classes
   - Added missing model classes like `ComponentMetrics` and `RemediationValidationResult`
   - Fixed implementation issues in `RemediationExecutor`

3. **Missing Implementations**: Added implementations for required interfaces
   - Implemented core interface methods in `RemediationService`
   - Created adapters for interface compatibility

## Next Steps

To make the project fully functional, the following steps are still needed:

1. Address the remaining code warnings and errors
2. Complete implementation of core components
3. Add unit tests to verify functionality
4. Improve documentation

## Architecture

The system follows a service-oriented architecture with the following key services:

- `RuntimeErrorSageService`: Main entry point for the system
- `RemediationService`: Handles remediation strategies
- `GraphAnalyzer`: Analyzes component dependencies
- `ErrorAnalyzer`: Analyzes errors using patterns and LLMs
