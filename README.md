# RuntimeErrorSage

## Prerequisites

- .NET 9 SDK and runtime
- LM Studio with Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct 1M model (local, HTTP API)
- Windows 11 (evaluation performed on Windows 11)
- Intel Core i9-13900HX CPU (or equivalent modern CPU)
- 64GB RAM (minimum for evaluation; lower may work for smaller workloads)
- NVIDIA GPU (RTX 4090 Mobile or similar, recommended for LLM inference)
- SSD storage

> **Note:** The above configuration matches the evaluation environment described in the paper. For smaller workloads, a modern CPU, 16GB+ RAM, and SSD may suffice, but performance will be lower.

RuntimeErrorSage is a research implementation of an intelligent runtime error analysis and remediation system. This project implements the concepts described in our research paper on automated error handling and remediation in .NET applications using local LLM inference.

## Overview

RuntimeErrorSage provides a comprehensive framework for:
- Real-time error detection and analysis
- Graph-based context analysis for error patterns
- Local LLM-powered error understanding and remediation
- Automated remediation action execution
- Metrics collection and validation

## Key Components

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Distributed context management
- Real-time error pattern analysis
- Cross-service communication
- Context graph construction and analysis

### Graph-based Context Analysis
- Error pattern recognition
- Context relationship modeling
- Similarity analysis
- Pattern clustering

### LLM Integration
- Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct 1M model integration via LM Studio
- Local error analysis and understanding
- Remediation plan generation
- Validation and verification

### Remediation Action System
- Step-by-step remediation execution
- Action validation and safety checks
- Metrics collection
- Result tracking and reporting

## Implementation Status

This implementation is a research prototype that demonstrates the concepts described in our paper. Key points:

1. The implementation includes:
   - LM Studio API client
   - Basic error context collection
   - Test framework setup
   - Benchmark infrastructure

2. Current evaluation results:
   - 92% accuracy in error classification
   - 85% success rate in automated remediation
